    Email Application

    Scenario: You are an IT Support Administrator Specialist and are
    charged with the task of creating email accounts for new hires.

    Your application should do the following:
    * Generate an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
    * Determine the department (sales, development, accounting), if none leave blank
    * Generate a random String for a password
    * Have set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define an alternate
      email address
    * Have get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity

        Note:
        Math.random() gives a random number between 0 and 1 (or referred as 1 unit).

        1. To get a random number between 0 to n, we have to do Math.random * n
        Eg: Random number between 0 to 8 requires a transformation of 8,
            Math.random * 8;

        2. To get a random number between x to y, where x is not starting from 0, we have to do Math.random + or - x
        Eg: Random number between 3 and 4 requires a translation of 3:
            Math.random + 3;

        3. Tp get a random number between x to y, where x is not starting from 0 and range is more than 1 unit (i.e. y is not x + 1),
        we have to do both translation and transformation
        Eg: Random number between 3 to 8 requires a translation of 3 and a transformation of 5 (since between 3 & 8 there is an increase of 5 units):
            (Math.random + 3) * 5
